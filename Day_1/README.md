# Introduction to Java

## WHAT IS JAVA?
  Java is an high level, 
  Object oriented, 
  platform independent programming Language.

## WHY JAVA IS FAMOUS?
- Secure : It does not allow direct memory access to system memory(no pointers), Bytecode verification, automatic memory management
- Portable : Bytecode is platform independent which runs on any OS(write once run anywhere)
- Multithreading : multiple tasks can run at the same time within one program

## Use cases:
- Large servers
- Games
- Cloud based application
- Banks(highly secure)
- Android apps

## JAVA PLATFORM 

Java Platform = JVM + JRE + JDK

- JRE(java run time environment) - JVM + Java class Libraries
- JVM(java virtual machine) - It is an engine that executes and runs the bytecode(.class file)
- JIT(Just-In-Time-Compiler) - part of JVM that improves performance of java programs
- JDK(java development kit) - It is a software contains (JRE + Development tools)

## JAVA WORKFLOW 

source code(.java) --> bytecode(.class) --> (JVM) --> OS --> Hardware

## COMPILE TIME AND RUN TIME

### Compile Time
- Compile time = before the program runs
- This is when the computer checks code and converts it.

### Run Time
- Run time = while the program is running
- Now the program is actually working.
- If something goes wrong while working, it’s a run-time error.
